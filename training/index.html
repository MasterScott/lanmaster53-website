<h2>Why Train with Me?</h2>
<p>There are too many Application Security testing and secure development classes that waste time by discussing multiple tools that serve the same purpose, or make Application Security concepts feel like "magic" by not addressing the practical application of theory. Using the tools I use and the techniques I've learned from years of Application Security consulting and software development, I provide training that focuses on bringing theory and reality together to provide a true learning experience. Training also gives me an opportunity to share my passion for Application Security and software development with individuals who make a real difference in the state of security for the applications that impact our daily lives. From banks, to social media, to government agencies, the opportunity to support those on the front line of Application Security is a privilege I don't take for granted.</p>

<h2>Practical Web Application Penetration Testing - PWAPT</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>No one wants to hire an Application Security consultant without experience, but it's difficult to gain experience unless you already work in the field or breach ethical boundaries. This is a challenge that many "green" Application Security professionals face. Born out of this need, PWAPT was designed to provide real world experience in a classroom environment, allowing for the growth required to enter the work force with confidence and competence. PWAPT was also designed to provide experienced Application Security consultants with a better defined testing methodology complimented by obscure vulnerability discovery techniques and "quality of life" tips and tricks to improve on a developed skill set. Regardless of skill level, PWAPT has something for everyone.</p>
<p>PWAPT provides comprehensive training on the latest open source tools and manual techniques for performing end-to-end web application penetration testing engagements. After a quick overview of the penetration testing methodology, the instructor will lead students through the process of testing and exploiting a target web application using the techniques and approaches developed from a career of real world application penetration testing experiences. Students will be introduced to the best tools currently available for the specific steps of the methodology, including Burp Suite Pro, and taught how to integrate these tools with manual testing techniques to maximize effectiveness. A major goal of this course is teaching students the glue that brings the tools and techniques together to successfully perform a web application penetration test from beginning to end, an oversight in most web application penetration testing courses. The end result is an individual with the confidence and skill set to conduct consultative web application penetration testing engagements.</p>
<p>The majority of the course will be spent performing an instructor led, hands-on web application penetration test against a target application built specifically for this class using a modern technology stack (Python Flask and React) and including real vulnerabilities as encountered in the wild. No old-school vanilla PHP stuff here folks. Students won't be given overly simplistic steps to execute independently. Rather, at each stage of the test, the instructor will present the goals that each testing task is to accomplish and perform the penetration test in front of the class while students do it on their own machine. Primary emphasis of these instructor led exercises will be placed on how to integrate the tools with manual testing procedures to improve the overall work flow. This experience will help students gain the confidence and knowledge necessary to perform web application penetration tests as an Application Security professional.</p>
<p>PWAPT is a PortSwigger preferred <a href="https://portswigger.net/training/">Burp Suite Training course</a>. PWAPT students will learn basic and advanced usage techniques for Burp Suite Pro, as well as discover obscure functionality hidden within the vast capabilities of the tool. Students will also receive a ~2 week trial license for Burp Suite Pro to use during and after the course.</p>
<p>For additional insight into the origin, mission, and benefits of PWAPT, listen to my interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/TimothyDeBlock">Timothy De Block</a> for the <a href="http://www.timothydeblock.com/eis/54">Exploring Information Security podcast</a> on the topic of "What is Practical Web Application Penetration Testing?" The course has developed significantly since the interview, but my philosophy remains the same.</p>

</ul>
<p>Note: The Conference Edition is an abbreviated version of the course designed to fit into the typical 2-day conference schedule. While not all content can be covered during the Conference Edition courses, all of the content will be provided for self-study.</p>
<h3>Skill Requirements</h3>
<p>Students taking this course should have introductory knowledge of the OWASP Top 10 and a thorough understanding of the HTTP protocol. Students do not need to be comfortable finding or exploiting common web vulnerabilities, but a general understanding is ideal. However, understanding the HTTP protocol is vital. PWAPT does not cover basic HTTP, but will reference it repeatedly assuming students are familiar with the protocol. PWAPT may also do this with some vulnerabilities, but will discuss them in further detail at a later time during the class.</p>
<p>Knowledge of web technologies and programming constructs will also be helpful, but are not required. PWAPT uses code to explain and demonstrate some vulnerabilities, and in the 4-day format contains exercises where the instructor and students modify the application's source code to implement mitigating controls.</p>
<p>While this is not an advanced course, PWAPT will strive to cover advanced topics if the ability level of the student population allows. Please prepare yourselves for the above requirements if you do not already meet them coming into the course. Anyone looking to get into Application Security or hone their craft should be working on their software development skills. If not already doing so, this is a good time to get started.</p>
<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Laptop with at least one (1) USB port.</li>
<li>Latest VMware Player, VMware Workstation, or VWware Fusion installed. Other virtualization software such as Parallels or VirtualBox will probably work if the attendee is familiar with its functionality. However, VMware Player should be prepared as a backup.</li>
<li>Ability to disable all security software on their laptop such as Antivirus and/or firewalls (Administrator).</li>
<li>At least twenty (20) GB of hard drive space.</li>
<li>At least four (4) GB of RAM.</li>
</ul>
